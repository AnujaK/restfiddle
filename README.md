Building From Source
==========

##### Prerequisites

* JDK 7 or later

* Maven 3.0+

* Gradle 2.4 (Optional)

* MongoDB

##### Build

```
mvn clean install
```

##### Run

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

##### Access

The build file is configured to download and use an embedded Tomcat server. So the application should be up and running by using just two commands mentioned above. Once the server is started, the application can be accessed using http://localhost:8080. 

```
Default login email / password : rf@example.com / rf
```

##### Debug

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000"
```

Note : To avoid java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space, use the following command:

```
MAVEN_OPTS="-XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m" mvn spring-boot:run 
```

##### MongoDB configuration:

Go to *src/main/resources/env-development.properties* and update mongodb properties. Here is how the sample configuration looks like:

```
mongodb.name=restfiddle

mongodb.host=localhost

mongodb.port=27017

mongodb.username=

mongodb.password=
```

##### Steps to re-build the database:

```
1. Stop RESTFiddle server, if running.
2. Start MongoDB, if not running.
	Here is the command I use : "C:\Program Files\MongoDB 2.6 Standard\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath C:\Users\ANUJA\Documents\restfiddle\data
3. Connect to MongoDB.
	Here is one of the ways to connect to MongoDB : 
	Go to "C:\Program Files\MongoDB 2.6 Standard\bin" folder and run "mongo" command.
	Then run "use restfiddle" command and finally "db.dropDatabase()" command to delete the existing RESTFiddle database.
	Note : you will see following message on the command prompt : { "dropped" : "restfiddle", "ok" : 1 }
4. Start RESTFiddle application (mvn spring-boot:run) - This will create and initialize the database.
```

##### Steps to recover database:

```
Sometimes MongoDB doesn't start and shows message:
        old lock file: C:\Users\ANUJA\Documents\restfiddledata\data\mongod.lock. probably means unclean shutdown
Run repair operation to recover your database
	"C:\Program Files\MongoDB 2.6 Standard\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath C:\Users\ANUJA\Documents\restfiddledata\data --repair
Most likely, your data will be repaired with the --repair option. In case it doesn't, delete the mongod.lock file and then run the above --repair command.
```

##### For Gradle Users:

*Build war*

Unix  : 
```
./gradlew clean war
```

Windows  : 
```
gradlew.bat clean war
```

*Run*


Unix  : 
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Windows  : 
```
gradlew.bat bootRun
```
Debugging in Windows : Add the following to build.gradle file and then run the above command
```
applicationDefaultJvmArgs = [
    "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000"
]
```
Deployment
==========

You can deploy the war file to Tomcat 7.0.52, Jetty, or any other container, as long as it supports servlet 3.0.
